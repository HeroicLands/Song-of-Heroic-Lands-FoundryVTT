    <p>The battleaxe is a formidable weapon featuring a heavy, broad blade mounted on a long handle. It is designed for powerful, cleaving strikes used to split shields, armor, and bones. In the heat of battle, warriors wield the battleaxe in sweeping motions, leveraging the momentum of its weight to deliver devastating blows. Its considerable reach and impact make it effective for both infantry and cavalry.</p>
    <p>Common variants of the battleaxe include the Danish axe, known for its elongated, crescent-shaped blade ideal for slashing and hooking movements, and the pollaxe, which features a hammer or spike on the reverse side, adding versatility in combat against armored foes.</p>

    <p>A throwing axe is a specialized weapon designed for being hurled at targets with precision and force. Typically featuring a weighted head and a balanced handle, the throwing axe utilizes the momentum and rotation generated by the thrower to ensure the blade strikes the target effectively.  Characterized by their distinctive curved blade, the throwing axe creates a tumbling motion that increases the likelihood of inflicting damage upon impact, regardless of which part of the axe hits the target. </p>
    <p>In combat, the throwing axe is used to disrupt enemy lines just before engaging in melee fighting. Warriors would throw their axes at advancing foes to break shields, injure soldiers, and create chaos among ranks. This tactic weakens the enemy&#39;s front line, making them vulnerable to subsequent close-quarters attacks. The throwing axe thus plays a crucial role in both offensive and defensive military strategies, serving as a precursor to direct combat by maximizing initial damage and disarray.</p>
